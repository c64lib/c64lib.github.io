== Installation
The C64Lib is a set of libraries that can be used in assembly programs written with Kick Assembler. Each library consists of one or more source files that shall be then imported in Kick Assembler program. There are several methods of downloading and "installation" of `c64lib` libraries, some of them will be presented there starting from the most convenient one.

=== Using Gradle as a build tool
The easiest way to use `c64lib` is to add the libraries as dependencies to the [Gradle][gradle] build. It is an easy task due to [Retro Assembler plugin][ra].

==== When Gradle is already used
Well, when you are a happy user of Retro Assembler plugin, then you are even happier, because it's extremely easy to add C64Lib to your project. The C64Lib is a GitHub project, so it can be added as GitHub dependency to your `gradle.build` file. Put the following lines into your `retroProject` section of the build file:

    libFromGitHub "c64lib/common", "0.1.0"
    libFromGitHub "c64lib/chipset", "0.1.0"
    libFromGitHub "c64lib/text", "0.1.0"
    libFromGitHub "c64lib/copper64", "0.1.0"

Then you will be able to use all four libraries from `c64lib`. Of course not all four are mandatory. You can use any subset of them as long as you obey dependency graph as shown in [here][libraries].

Retro Assembler plugin downloads all dependencies into default location:

    .ga/deps

All libraries from `c64lib` will be downloaded under `c64lib` subfolder therefore the following location:

    .ga/deps/c64lib

must be added to the lib dir so that Kick Assembler will see them when interpreting `#import` directive. The following must be also a part of your `gradle.build` file:

    libDirs = [".ra/deps/c64lib"]

The complete `gradle.build` will be following:

    plugins {
        id "com.github.c64lib.retro-assembler" version "1.0.1"
    }

    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    apply plugin: "com.github.c64lib.retro-assembler"

    retroProject {
        dialect = "KickAssembler"
        dialectVersion = "5.9"
        libDirs = [".ra/deps/c64lib"]

        libFromGitHub "c64lib/common", "0.1.0"
        libFromGitHub "c64lib/chipset", "0.1.0"
        libFromGitHub "c64lib/text", "0.1.0"
        libFromGitHub "c64lib/copper64", "0.1.0"
    }

In order to build your executable you just need to execute gradle:

    gradlew

or

    gradlew build

In result C64 executables (a `prg` files) will be created.

==== When Gradle is not used
but you really want to start using it, you have to enable it first. Following steps are requires as preconditions:

1. Download and install JDK 8 or higher from [Oracle][java].
1. Download and install [Gradle][gradle].

Once it is done, you have to restart your console/terminal application and go to your project location. In your location you run Gradle to install a wrapper:

    gradle wrapper

then you add `gradle.build` file using following content (or similar):

    plugins {
        id "com.github.c64lib.retro-assembler" version "1.0.1"
    }

    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    apply plugin: "com.github.c64lib.retro-assembler"

    retroProject {
        dialect = "KickAssembler"
        dialectVersion = "5.9"
        libDirs = [".ra/deps/c64lib"]

        libFromGitHub "c64lib/common", "0.1.0"
        libFromGitHub "c64lib/chipset", "0.1.0"
        libFromGitHub "c64lib/text", "0.1.0"
        libFromGitHub "c64lib/copper64", "0.1.0"
    }

Of course, the set of used libraries (with `libFromGitHub` element) may vary as well as the version of Kick Assembler.

And that's it: from now on you are able to build your project using simple `gradlew` or `gradlew build` commands. It's not even necessary to have Gradle installed. All you need is Java 8 or higher.

=== Manual clone from GitHub
If you don't want to or cannot use [Retro Assembler plugin][ra], you can use your git client and clone libraries manually and then just point the location with `-libdir` parameter of the KickAss.

Lets assume your project has following directory layout on the disk:

    work
      |--libs
      +--project
           |--SomeFile.asm
           +--SomeOtherFile.asm

Then you go to the `libs` directory (`cd work/libs`), and then clone as many libraries from `c64lib` as you need:

    git clone https://github.com/c64lib/common.git
    git clone https://github.com/c64lib/chipset.git
    git clone https://github.com/c64lib/text.git
    git clone https://github.com/c64lib/copper64.git

This will checkout latest released version of the library (actually a top of the `master` branch, which usually means the same). In result you will get something like this:

    work
      |--libs
      |    +--common
      |         +--lib
      |              |--common.asm
      |              |--invoke.asm
      |              |--invoke-global.asm
      |              |--math.asm
      |              |--math-global.asm
      |              |--mem.asm
      |              +--mem-global.asm
      |    +--chipset
      |         |--...
      |    +--text
      |         |--...
      |    +--copper64
      |         |--...
      +--project
           |--SomeFile.asm
           +--SomeOtherFile.asm

If you then specify `-libdir` parameter to the KickAss appropriately, you'll be able to use the libs (asm files in `lib` directory) with simple `#import` directive, i.e.:

    #import "common/lib/math-global.asm"

As mentioned earlier, checkout from `master` branch ensures that last released version of library is used. If you want to change it and use concrete version from the past, after `git clone` you have to enter cloned directory (i.e. `cd common`) and checkout desired version:

    git checkout 1.0.0

(for version `1.0.0`).

Assembling is then possible with manual invocation of Kick Assembler:

    java -jar c:\ka\KickAss.jar -libdir ../libs SomeFile.asm
    java -jar c:\ka\KickAss.jar -libdir ../libs SomeOtherFile.asm


=== Manual copy
Least desired method of installation of `c64lib` is to download source code of given version and unzipping it into target directory. It is not a very convenient method but it does not require [Gradle][gradle] nor Git to be installed on your computer.

For every library module you have to visit GitHub and open Releases tab:

    https://github.com/c64lib/common/releases/tag/0.1.0

Under assets you will see zipped content of the library. Download it and unzip into desired location, i.e. into `libs` directory. In result you end up with similar layout as with "Git clone" method (see above).

You use exactly the same method to use library in your source code, i.e.:

    #import "common/lib/invoke_global.asm"

and you invoke Kick Assembler using the same syntax:

    java -jar c:\ka\KickAss.jar -libdir ../libs SomeFile.asm

assuming, that your `libs` directory exists on the same level as your project directory.
